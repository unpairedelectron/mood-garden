# MoodGarden 2.0: Ethical Framework & Red Lines

## **Core Ethical Principles**

### **1. Therapeutic Primacy**
*"First, do no harm" - all features must serve user wellbeing*

**Commitments:**
- Every AI recommendation reviewed by licensed therapists
- No addictive game mechanics that exploit emotional vulnerability
- Crisis detection triggers immediate professional intervention pathways
- User progress never monetized through artificial scarcity

**Red Line:** Never prioritize engagement over mental health outcomes

---

### **2. Data Sovereignty & Privacy**

**Absolute Protections:**
- **End-to-end encryption** for all mood, voice, and biometric data
- **User owns all data** - can export or delete at any time
- **Zero data sales** to third parties (insurance, employers, advertisers)
- **On-device processing** for sensitive mood analysis when possible

**Transparency Requirements:**
- Monthly "Data Dignity Reports" showing exactly how user data flows
- Open-source mood analysis algorithms for academic peer review
- User-friendly privacy dashboard with granular controls

**Red Line #1: NEVER sell or share mood data with insurance companies, employers, or data brokers**

---

### **3. Algorithmic Accountability**

**AI Safety Measures:**
- **Bias testing** across demographics, cultures, neurodivergence
- **Explainable AI** - users understand why plants grow certain ways
- **Human override** - therapists can correct AI recommendations
- **Regular audits** by external ethics boards and clinical advisors

**Content Safeguards:**
- AI cannot diagnose mental health conditions (refers to professionals)
- Therapeutic metaphors validated by trauma-informed care specialists
- Cultural sensitivity review for plant symbolism across global users

**Red Line #2: AI systems must remain tools for human therapists, never replace professional care**

---

### **4. Inclusive Design & Accessibility**

**Universal Access Commitments:**
- Free tier provides clinically meaningful support (not just a teaser)
- Accessibility features for visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive differences
- Multi-language support with culturally appropriate therapeutic approaches
- Reduced-cost access for students, seniors, and low-income users

**Trauma-Informed Principles:**
- Users control all environmental stimuli (sound, visual intensity, movement)
- Multiple "safe space" options for different trauma responses
- No unexpected triggers (content warnings for intensity changes)
- Option to engage anonymously without social pressure

**Red Line #3: Premium features cannot create two-tiered mental healthcare**

---

## **Governance Structure**

### **Ethics Review Board**
- **2 Licensed Therapists** (trauma-informed care specialists)
- **1 Neurodivergent Self-Advocate**

## **Crisis Intervention Protocol**

### **Detection Triggers**
- Severe mood deterioration over 48 hours

### **Response Hierarchy**
1. **Immediate:** In-app grounding exercises and crisis resources
2. **Within 10 minutes:** Human crisis counselor contact attempt
3. **Within 30 minutes:** Emergency contacts notified (if user consented)
4. **Follow-up:** Check-in 24 hours later with professional support options

### **Never Automated**
- Emergency services contact (requires human assessment)
- Sharing crisis details with family/friends without explicit consent
- Psychiatric medication recommendations
